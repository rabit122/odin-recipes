<p><h4> Moussaka is a dish I did not appreciate until I was older, I've mentioned before why was that. 
   The Egyptian version of Moussaka usually does not have that bechamel layer. 
   This is what we call in Egypt Moussaka bel bechamel.</h4> </p>

<ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<li> round meat: Use beef, lamb or a mixture. In my home, my mom always used beef. </li>
    <li> Onion: for the base flavor and sometimes people also use garlic alone or with the onion.</li>
        <li> Olive oil: for the main fat for browning.</li>
            <li> Spices: cinnamon, ginger and allspice are the main flavor boosters here, but you can use other spices as well.
                Bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, oregano, Italian seasoning,... etc.</li>
                    <li> Broth: as a cooking liquid.</li>
                        <li> Tomato and tomato paste: for color, taste and texture.</li>
                            <li>Butter and olive oil: combined for cooking the flour.</li>
                                <li>Salt and pepper: you can use white pepper but I always like black pepper more.</li>
                                    <li>Flour: of course for making the sauce and thickening it.</li>
                                        <li>Parmesan cheese: for extra flavor, you can use Romano as well. I've seen people even use feta.</li>
                                            <li>Egg: for richness and color.</li>
                                                <li>Broth/Milk: use any or both. I've used a mixture of 2/3 milk and 1/3 homemade beef broth.</li>

<h4>steps</h4>
<li> Add olive oil to a pan over high heat and sautee onion for a couple of minutes.</li>

    <li>Add the ground meat, break it apart and brown until no longer pink.</li>

        <li>Add the spices and mix well. Pour in the broth and the tomato sauce and mix.</li>

            <li>Add the diced tomato and lower the heat and simmer for about 10-15 minutes. Set aside.</li>

                <li>Make the Bechamel sauce by first melting butter with oil in a skillet large enough to hold the sauce.</li>

                    <li>Add the flour and cook for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>

                        <li>Now slowly pour the milk or broth and whisking continuously until sauce thickens. 
                        Season with salt and pepper then set aside to cool down for 5 minutes so we can add the egg without cooking it right away.</li>

                            <li>Crack an egg and add the Parmesan cheese. Stir well.</li>

                                <li>Now it is time to layer the dish. In a safe oven dish arrange half of the eggplant at the bottom of your dish.</li>

                                    <li>Top that with the meat mixture and add the jalape√±o pepper if using.</li>

                                        <li>Arrange the remaining eggplant slices.</li>

                                            <li>Pour bechamel sauce over, tilt the pan or level the top with a spatula. 
                                            Bake in the oven until the bechamel layer is lightly browned and the dish is bubbly.</li>
